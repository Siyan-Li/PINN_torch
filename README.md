# PINN_torch
This repository, "PINN_torch", is dedicated to documenting simple code examples written during the learning process of solving problems in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) using PyTorch. It serves as a practical resource for those interested in exploring the intersection of physics and deep learning.
